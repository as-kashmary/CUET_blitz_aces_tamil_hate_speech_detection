## Caste and Migration Hate Speech Detection
This repository contains code for the LT-EDI@LDK 2025 Shared Task on Caste and Migration Hate Speech Detection in Tamil language social media content.

Task Overview
The task focuses on developing automatic classification models that can identify:

i) Caste/Migration-related Hate Speech
ii) Non-Caste/Migration-related Hate Speech
Our solution addresses the challenge of detecting hate speech in Tamil, a relatively low-resource language, contributing to creating safer and more inclusive online spaces.
